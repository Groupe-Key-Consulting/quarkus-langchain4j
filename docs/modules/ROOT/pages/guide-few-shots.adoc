= Implementing Few-Shot Prompting

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]
include::./includes/customization.adoc[]

Few-shot prompting lets you guide an LLM by embedding a handful of input–output examples directly in the prompt—no fine-tuning required.
It strikes a balance between zero-shot and one-shot prompting, boosting accuracy on tasks like classification, extraction, and summarization while keeping your code simple.

This guide walks you through three implementation steps to build a sentiment-classification microservice using Quarkus LangChain4j.

== What is the Few-Shot Technique

Few-shot prompting is an in-context learning technique where you provide two or more _input–output demonstrations_ in the same prompt to establish a pattern the model can generalize.
This approach:

* Improves accuracy over zero- and one-shot prompting for complex tasks.
* Avoids the overhead of model fine-tuning or external retrieval.
* Is ideal for tasks requiring a consistent output format or style.

However, this technique is not intended to be used to add new knowledge to the model, but rather to guide its output style and format.

== Step 1. Define the AI service

Declare your AI Service interface with CDI and LangChain4j annotations so Quarkus can manage it:
In this example, we will create a service that classifies text sentiment as either positive or negative.

[source,java]
----
package io.quarkiverse.langchain4j.samples.fewshots;

import dev.langchain4j.service.SystemMessage;
import dev.langchain4j.service.UserMessage;
import io.quarkiverse.langchain4j.RegisterAiService;


@RegisterAiService
@SystemMessage("You are an assistant that classifies text sentiment.")
public interface SentimentAiService {
    // few-shot method defined in Step 2
}
----

Here, `@RegisterAiService` creates the xref:ai-services.adoc[AI Service], and `@SystemMessage` supplies the global instruction for all methods in the service.

== Step 2. Add Few-Shots

Inside the same interface, define a method with `@UserMessage` that inlines your examples:

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-dir}/io/quarkiverse/langchain4j/samples/fewshots/SentimentAiService.java[]
----

<1>	The multi-line string contains two complete "INPUT: … OUTPUT: …" pairs followed by the placeholder `\{text}` for the new query.
<2> When the method is invoked, Quarkus Langchain4j will replace `\{text}` with the actual text parameter.

[TIP]
While in this example we added the few-shot example in the user message, they can also be added in the system message.

== Step 3. Invoke the AI Service from an HTTP Endpoint

Finally, expose a REST resource that injects and calls your AI Service:

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-dir}/io/quarkiverse/langchain4j/samples/fewshots/SentimentResource.java[]
----

This `SentimentResource` bean handles HTTP GET requests, delegates to the few-shot prompt method, and returns the classification.
The endpoint can be tested with a simple HTTP client or browser by accessing:

[source,curl]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/sentiment?text=I%20love%20this%20product!
----

== Conclusion

By defining an AI service, embedding a few-shot prompt, and wiring it to a REST endpoint, you’ve built a complete sentiment-classification microservice with minimal code.
